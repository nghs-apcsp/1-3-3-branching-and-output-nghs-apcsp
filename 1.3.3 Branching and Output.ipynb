    "Computers can sometimes appear intelligent because they can make a decision. A program that lets you text from a mobile device might decide to autocorrect your text. A program to provide driving directions might decide you've gone the wrong way. All programming languages have a way to branch, executing one set of instructions or another, depending on a condition. \n",
    "\n",
    "How is this done in Python® programming language? And how can we get output from a program to know what the program has decided?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous activity, you learned that you can assign values to variables of different types. You learned that you can evaluate expressions and can define functions that return a value.\n",

    "## Part 1: Conditionals\n",
    "\n",
    "As you saw in Scratch™ programming language, computer programs can use if structures to make decisions. In an if structure, what gets executed depends on whether a Boolean expression, also known as a conditional, is true.\n",

    "Here is what a boolean expression looks like in python\n",
    "```python\n",

    "Out[]: True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the single = is used for assignment, while the double == is used to compare two expressions to see if they are equal. Other comparison operators that can be used to create a Boolean expression include >= (for ≥) and != (for ≠). \n",
    "\n",
    "You can make compound conditionals by connecting Boolean expressions \n",
    "with and, or, and not. In the following examples, remember that a is still 3.\n",
